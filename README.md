# TA Management System
In this project we are developing and implementing a TA management system for SMU to automate the process for applying and hiring TA's using Play Framework.

## Pre-setup
Before downloading our project, make sure you have installed Java version 1.8 and the IntelliJ IDE. Next, install Docker at https://www.docker.com/get-started and mySQL

## Backend
### Initial SetUp: Download the project and open the Ebean-backend folder in IntelliJ. Once the folder opens, click on run -> EditConfigurations -> Play2App -> Click run. Once the window opens, change the port to port 9005.  

### Connect the Database:  
1. Click Database on the side
2. Click the + â†’ click Data Source
3. Choose MySQL  
 
Set the databse name to one of your choosing, set the port number to the same port to match that when downloading mySQL, and make sure your driver version matches your installed MySQLversion.  

### Create Schema: Lastly, right click on localhost and create a new scheme.
